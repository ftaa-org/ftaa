FTAA made a submission through the Australian Federal Government Ministers and other delegates to National Accreditation Authority of Translators and Interpreters (NAATI) in 2014. NAATI has reviewed the demand supply for the Telugu Community whether there is a need to recognise Telugu. There is a general belief that all Telugu people speak good English and since there is no requirement. The main reason to fail this initiation was the Australian Census 2011 reflects about 7,500 people speak Telugu at home. This has prompted FTAA to raise the Census awareness program in 2016 and this has resulted in ABS Census 2016 reflects there are about 36,000 Telugu speaking people living in Australia. FTAA believes the community is much larger than this reflection. FTAA is initiating another drive for all Telugu Speaking people to participate and sign the petition “Telugu to Be Recognised as Australian Community Language”. FTAA is collaboratively making another submission to Australian Government in early 2018. This petition can provide more representative size of Telugu community in Australia and its need.
